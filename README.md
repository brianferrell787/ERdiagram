# Postgres-DB-with-Docker

In this repository I have a assignment working with a pretend scenario of a Bike shop, and then I also have a project where I created a database using Postgres and Docker that contains 
community-engaged research data and their corresponding tables. There are diagrams for both projects, and the main project also has a report on what Community Engagement is, along with the 
SQL code I used to create the relational database. Enjoy!
